The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\",\"key_points\":[\"Introduces the Transformer model based solely on attention mechanisms.\",\"Achieves state-of-the-art results on English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks.\",\"Demonstrates significant improvements in training time and parallelization.\",\"Shows applicability of model to other tasks, like English constituency parsing.\"],\"used_models\":[\"Transformer\"],\"topic\":\"Natural Language Processing\",\"classification\":\"Machine Translation\",\"publication_year\":2023,\"source\":\"arXiv\",\"doi\":\"10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762\",\"keywords\":[\"Transformer\",\"Machine Translation\",\"Attention Mechanisms\",\"Neural Networks\"],\"experimental_results\":\"The Transformer model achieved 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and 41.8 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-French task.\",\"future_research_directions\":\"Exploring attention-based models for other tasks including image, audio, and video processing, and investigating local, restricted attention mechanisms.\",\"references\":[\"Kyunghyun Cho et al. - Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation (2014)\",\"Dzmitry Bahdanau et al. - Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (2014)\",\"Denny Britz et al. - Massive Exploration of Neural Machine Translation Architectures (2017)\",\"Yonghui Wu et al. - Google’s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation (2016)\"]}
