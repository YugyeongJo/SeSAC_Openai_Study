On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.","key_points":["Introduces the Transformer architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating recurrence and convolutions.","Achieves state-of-the-art performance on English-to-German (28.4 BLEU) and English-to-French (41.8 BLEU) translation tasks.","Demonstrated faster training times compared to previous models, completing training in 3.5 days using 8 GPUs.","Shows strong generalization capabilities across tasks, successfully applied to English constituency parsing.","Model employs multi-head attention, which allows for efficient modeling of dependencies across sequences."]}
